If successful, we’ll improve the efficacy of fraudulent transaction alerts for millions of people around the world, helping hundreds of thousands of businesses reduce their fraud loss and increase their revenue. 

In this competition you are predicting the probability that an online transaction is fraudulent, as denoted by the binary target isFraud.

The data is broken into two files identity and transaction, which are joined by TransactionID. Not all transactions have corresponding identity information.
